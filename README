This repository is an application of what I learned from the "Web Application Architectures" course's first few videos.

It specifically illustrates how blogs are made applying the following ruby on rails commands:

1. rails new blog  
		=>for creating a new project called "blog"
2. rails generate scaffold post title:string body:text
		=>for generating the MVC components needed for posts
3. rails generate scaffold comment post_id:integer body:text
		=>for generating the MVC components for the comments with an integer id to connect it to a particular post
